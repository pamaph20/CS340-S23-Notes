# Lecture 21 outline, 4/5/2023

## Overview

In class we discussed localization of faults and the incorporation of the Ochiai and Tarantula formulas into the localized.py program. We started the topic of how to find which commit a bug occurred. We also started to download ruby. 

## Class Notes
Automate localization of Faults
- loaded a unit test suite from file
- ran with coverage

What data did we store:

    Lines covered on passing test
    
    Lines covered onf aling tests
    
    Total tests failed
    
    Total tests passed
    
Tarantula: $S(l) = \frac{\frac{failed(l)}{totalFailed}}{\frac{failed(l)}{totalFailed} + \frac{passed(l)}{totalPassed}}$

- tarantula function in LinuxLab
- tarantula scores (functional programs)

Ochiai: $S(l) = \frac{failed(l)}{\sqrt{totalFailed*(failed(l)+passed(l))}}$

### Debugging as Hypothesis Testing
Review Q: What makes up a good bug report?

Steps to reproduce $\rightarrow$ minimized (also apply to input data)
  
- Mozilla Engineers had lots of open bug reports that were not minimized
- Mozilla ran a Bug-a-thon crowd sourced simplification

Ex/ FF $\rightarrow$ print page causes a crash
- What part of the HTML is causing the crash?

Another problem where minimization ccan help:
- Yesteray your code worked, today it does not
- Why? - a number of commits
  - which commit?

>#### Definition
>**Causality** is influence by which one evenet, process, state or object (a cause) contributes to the production of anothe event, process, state or object,   (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effeect and the effect is partly dependent on the cause

>#### Definition
>**Counterfactual** theories of causation:
>If A had not ccurred, then C would not have occurred

- In software - the cause of a bug is precisely the difference between two versions

Can we find the commit that causes the failure?
- point that goes from work $\rightarrow$ fail

Idea: Replay commits $\rightarrow$ runtime? $O(n)$

Better way: Binary Search! $O(log(n))$

## Supplementary Material

Below is the txt file from Kevin's Website on how to download an updated Ruby and helpful git commands
```
We need an older version of Ruby to run this example. We can install it 
using `rbenv`, which is similar to Python's virtual environments.

Set up the environment:
  * sudo apt update
  * sudo apt install git curl autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm6 libgdbm-dev libdb-dev
  * curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
  * echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  * echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
  * source ~/.bashrc
  * rbenv install 2.7.8
  * rbenv global 2.7.8

github_url: https://github.com/floere/phony
good_tag: v1.9.0
bad_tag: v2.10.0
test_command: ruby -e 'require "./lib/phony"; Phony.normalize("999")'

We will use `git bisect` to find the commit where the failure begins.

Useful commands:

git bisect start: start a bisecting search
git bisect good: mark a commit as "good"
git bisect bad: mark a commit as "bad"
git bisect reset: get out of a bisecting search
git bisect run: run a script to automate the search (needs a good and bad mark)
```
## Something Fun

Loooking for bad apples!!
