## Notes

_Software vs. Programs_

> ### Program
>Collection of instructions or ordered operations for a computer to preform a function or task

>### Software
>Collection of programs procedures, data, or instructions that work together to provide a specified functionality

- Similarities and differences:
    - similarities: programming languages, coding
    - differences: public, size, security, usability, quality control

_Time allocation to various SE tasks_

- 70 - 90% of the budget / time is spent on maintenance

_Linux / command line_
- typical program / commands_
- _loops / conditions_
- _file path (`basename`' & `dirname`' commands)_
- _scripting (shabang / permissions)_
- _text editors (`nano`' and `vim`')_


- Command lines give access to run tools under the hood
- Shell is a program that exposes an OS' services to a human user or other programs
- A shell script is a text file containing commands for a shell to execute
    - The first line starts with a "shabang" or `#!/bin/bash`'
- Useful commands:
    - `chmod`': a command to change permissions
        - `chmod +x \<file>`': is used to make a file executable
    - `ls`': list the content in a directory
    - `pwd`': present working directory
    - `cd`': change directory
    - `curl`': transfer from URL
    - `mkdir`': make directory
    - `less`': open file
    - `man`': help manual
    - `ssh`': secure shell, allows remote access to shell on another computer
    - `basename`': extracts only the file name
    - `dirname`': extracts only the file path
    - `|` (pipe): take output from one program as input to a second program
    - `xargs`': popes but as command line arguments
    - `cut`': delimiter to break up lines
    - `wc`': word count

___
- For loop: 
```
for i in {0..100}
    do
    ...
    done
```
- Conditionals:
```
if [-f name]
    then
        ...
    else
        ...
fi
```
    - `f`' is used for files
    - `d`' is used for directories
    - `z`' is to check for empty files

____
- Redirecting
    - `'\>`': overwriting the target file
    - `'\>>`': appends to the target file
    - `2>`': sends the error output
    - `1>`': sends the standard output

- Text editors: nano, vi(m), emacs
    - vi commands:
        - `i;`' insert mode
        - `':q!`' force quit, no ! for quit
        - `':w`' write the file
        - \<escape> leave insert mode

- _Version Control Systems_
    - _centralized vs. distributed_
    - _deltas vs. snapshots_
    - _git basics → staging & working directory_
    - _commit histories_
    - _branching, tags, head_
    - _rebase, merge_
    - _remote / pull requests / forks_
    - _commit messages best practices_

- Dominant activity of software development is maintenance
- Version control systems allow modifying files, mark files as ready to contribute, and bundle and share changes to everyone.
- Version control systems simplify maintaining code
- Centralized systems:
    - 1 unified history
    - everyone agrees  on versions available 
    - client must have a set of working files
    - to commit revisions a user must connect to the main server
- Distributed system:
    - shared history
    - redundancy → multiple copies of history
    - client makes copy on own system
    - client check in / commits to their own history 
    - potential for disagreement, so there must be a way to resolve conflicts and sync histories
- Encoding the history of a repository:
    1. Deltas: track the changes (deltas) and save those changes
    2. Snapshots: keep full copies of changed files while the unchanged files are pointers to previous versions
- Git workspace has 3 states / locations:
    1. Working directory
    2. Staging
    3. Repository
- History of a repository forms a tree
    - Committing is inserting a new node
- Head: marks our working directory
- Hashes create unique IDs for each commit
- Branches are additional labels to keep track of parts and version history
- Tags are permeant label or nickname on a commit 
- Recombining branches 
    1. `merge`: combine commits & form a new commit with combined changes (two parents)
    2. `rebase`: "copy" the commits into another branch - like a transplant
- Commits:
    - message should describe problem being solved or features being added
        - can reference a bug report but should stand alone
    - don't want to assume access to outside resources
    - describe changes being done
    - first line of the message should be the subject
    - message should wrap at 72 or 80 characters
    ` nano -r 72`
- Dos and Don'ts:
    - don't mix whitespace / formatting with functional changes
    - don't mix unrelated functional changes
    - don't submit all code with one commit
    - do try to keep commits small & modular
- Git
    - git is a distributed version control system
    - connect a repo to another copy of the repo specify by ` git remote -v `
    - Sync commands:
        1. `git fetch`: download new commits from remote
        2. `git merge`: combine downloaded commits with local history 
        3. `git pull`: does both the operations of a fetch and merge commands
        4. `git push`: upload our new commits to the remote
    - all remote branches are prefixed with the remote in the name
        - example: `hans/main`
    - general rule:
        1. `rebase`' unshared changes
        2. `merge`' with shared changes
    - pull requests: request for developer to pull your commits to upstream repo
        1. Assign yourself an issue / bug report 
        2. Fork/clone the repo
        3. Make branch for the fix
        4. Commit to the new branch
        5. Push to the fork
        6. Open a full request

- Developers want to deliver high quality software at low cost

>### Quality Assurance  
>The maintenance of desired level of quality in a service or product, especially by means of attention to every stage of the delivery or production

- Two types of quality
    1. External: customer facing, essentially does the software do the right thing
    2. Internal: source code is readable, well document, maintainable
- Internal quality is mostly about maintainability
    - human code review
    - code analysis tools (linters)
    - - use programming idioms & design standards
    - follow local coding standards
- Rice's Theorem: prevents programs from always giving the right answer, all non-trivial semantic properties are undecidable
    - x is not always wrong, but not always right
- We approximate correctness with type checkers, linters, static analysis
- Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholder with information about quality of software
- Testing gives confidence that your implementation adheres to specification
- An oracle is the source of sample  output for test cases
- System testing: test end-to-end system for correctness 
- Regression testing: try to see regression in the source code
- Unit testing: test chunks of code
    - frameworks: JUnit, Python unittest
- Test cases:
    1. Establish some condition
    2. Preform an operation
    3. Assert post condition
    - each test case should be run in a "fresh environment"
- Test fixture: surrounds a test case to provide code that is run before and after each test case
- Unit testing discover: python3 -m unittesting discovery
- Test driven discover:
    1. Write a test to add a new feature 
    2. Write code that the unit test is testing for
    3. Run all available tests
- Integration testing: one layer up from unit, do the chunks work well together?
- Challenges of testing:
    1. Different hardware configurations
    2. What if the tool is broken? (test is broken)
    3. Cost / speed (external APIs)
- Mocking: using mock objects (simulated objects) that mimic the behavior of real objects in a controlled way
    - cash test dummies, sometimes called stubs
- Functional properties: correct solution
- Non-functional properties:  memory, runtime, security, power, performance with many users
- Load testing: how does the system respond under typical usage
    - stress test → test under extreme usage
- Testing & QA  is about 25-35% of IT budgets

- Measuring quality of tests: 
    - code coverage: how much code is executed by the test suite
    - statement coverage: fraction of source code statements that are executed by test suite → loosely the same as line coverage
    - test suite quality metrics asses the quality of a test suite (with respect toe external notion o futility) and allows test suites to be compared
        - line coverage is on such metrics
    - how do we measure line coverage?
        - coverage instrumentation programs that auto modify code to track coverage, such as `python coverage` or `gcc gcov`
    - implicit control flow: hidden if statements
    - interest test cases cause implicit or explicit changes of control → causes different branches of conditionals to execute
    - branch coverage: total number of conditional branches covered by test suite
